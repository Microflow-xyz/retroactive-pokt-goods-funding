### Technical details

- **EAS** - Projects, lists, profiles, etc are all stored on-chain in Ethereum Attestation Service
- **Batched requests with tRPC** - Multiple requests are batched into one (for example when the frontend requests the metadata for 24 projects they are batched into 1 request)
- **Server-side caching of requests to EAS and IPFS** - Immediately returns the data without calling EAS and locally serving ipfs cids.
- **SQL database for ballots** - Votes are stored privately in a Postgres database
  - Could votes be stored on EAS as well? It would need to happen server-side from an admin signer to keep voters anonymous.
